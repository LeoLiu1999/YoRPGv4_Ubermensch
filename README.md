# YoRPGv4


Welcome to our RPG! Created by the Ubermenschen, we hope everyone enjoys this!


Additional Feature: Changes in progress.
    <ul> <li>We changed our YoRPG.java so that the player can enter the number of moves desired in the game.</li>
    <li>We gave each player 5 health potions and added an option to use one at every turn.</li>
    <li> It now shows the player's and monster's health and the number of health potions the player has left</li>
    <li> Players have a chance to get a health potion when they kill a monster.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
Code Restructuring:
    Not much honestly. For now, additional features haven't required us to change the way our code previously worked.
    
How to Play:
